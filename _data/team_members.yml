  info: Christian Fiebach is Professor of Cognitive Neuroscience at Goethe University Frankfurt. He is also a PI at Goethe University’s Brain Imaging Center. His research is aimed at understanding the brain mechanisms underlying higher cognitive abilities such as language comprehension and visual word recognition, cognitive flexibility, as well as neurobiological correlates of individual differences in general cognitive ability (intelligence). To this end, he uses non-invasive neuroimaging methods, in particular functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiology.

- name: Gemma Roig (co-speaker)
  photo: roig.jpg
  info: Gemma Roig is Professor of Data Analytics and Modeling at the Computer Science Department of Goethe University Frankfurt., Her research focuses on understanding the computational principles underlying visual intelligence of humans and artificial systems, with the aim of developing a general artificial intelligence framework. To this end, she develops computational models using deep learning and state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms, and uses those to explain behavioural and brain data, including fMRI and EEG.

  info: Matthias Kaschube is Professor for Computational Neuroscience and Computational Vision in the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at Goethe University, and Senior Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies. His research focuses on the interplay of the different factors (llike genetic vs. sensory inout) leading to the development of cortical circuits, on relevant features of brain circuits that support cognitive processes, as well as the robustness of cortical circuits against cellular, subcellular and molecular changes.

  info: Yee Lee Shing is Professor of Developmental Psychology at Goethe University Frankfurt. Her research focuses on the development of cognitive and brain functions across the human lifespan, with an emphasis on long-term memory and predictive processing. She makes use of neuroimaging techniques (e.g., structural and functional MRI, EEG) and multivariate developmental methodology (e.g., structural equation and latent growth curve modeling) to investigate the unfolding of brain-behavior relationships across time.

  info: Jochen Triesch is Johanna Quandt Professor for Theoretical Life Sciences at the Frankfurt Institute of Advanced Studies. He is also affiliated as Professor with Goethe University Frankfurt’s Departments of Physics, Computer Science and Mathematics. His research uses computer models to simulate brain function, particularly to investigate how cognitive processes and intelligent perception, action and thought arise from the interplay of millions of relatively simple nerve cells and their self-organization into networks.

    <h6 style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;"> A European perspective on structural barriers to women`s career progression in neuroscience </h6>
    <b>Date and Time:</b> 07th May 2024, 12:00 - 14:00 <br>
    <b> Location: </b> Seminar room 5G 170,PEG, Westend Campus, Goethe University <br>
    Despite an unprecedented number of women entering neuroscience, and decades-long recruitment and retention efforts, women continue to be disproportionately underrepresented in European academic tenure-track faculty and leadership positions. This Perspective focuses on two major career points where women exhibit diminished representation: the transition from postdoctoral fellow to junior professor and the promotion to more senior (tenured) faculty positions. We discuss below recently implemented country-specific and Europe-wide initiatives supporting equal career progression and propose further concrete steps to be taken to break down the structural barriers that prevent women’s progression up the academic career ladder as European neuroscientists. <br> 
    <h6 style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;"> Training for female scientists </h6>
    The Career Support – Training for Female Scientists* program offered by the Office for Equal Opportunities at Goethe University, offers variety of courses tailored to the specific needs of postdocs (R2 and R3). These training courses are measures designed to counteract the structural disadvantages faced by women* in the scientific field.

    Neuroimaging has greatly extended our capacity to study the workings of the human brain. Despite the wealth of knowledge this tool has generated however, there are still critical gaps in our understanding. While tremendous progress has been made in mapping areas of the brain that are specialized for particular stimuli, or cognitive processes, we still know very little about how large-scale interactions between different cortical networks facilitate the integration of information and the execution of complex tasks. Yet even the simplest behavioral tasks are complex, requiring integration over multiple cognitive domains. Our knowledge falls short not only in understanding how this integration takes place, but also in what drives the profound variation in behavior that can be observed on almost every task, even within the typically developing (TD) population. The search for the neural underpinnings of individual differences is important not only philosophically, but also in the service of precision medicine. We approach these questions using a three-pronged approach. First, we create a battery of behavioral tasks from which we can calculate objective measures for different aspects of the behaviors of interest, with sufficient variance across the TD population. Second, using these individual differences in behavior, we identify the neural variance which explains the behavioral variance at the network level. Finally, using covert neurofeedback, we perturb the networks hypothesized to correspond to each of these components, thus directly testing their casual contribution. I will discuss our overall approach, as well as a few of the new directions we are currently pursuing

    How does the human brain transform experiences into concepts and how do we use those representations flexibly? Recent evidence suggests that the ability to extract commonalities and to mark distinction across experiences to build generalisable knowledge is supported by the same brain mechanisms that create cognitive maps of physical spaces. In my talk I will present a series of behavioral and neuroimaging (fMRI) studies  that suggest that the hippocampal-entorhinal system encodes the structure of behaviorally relevant conceptual spaces, thereby supporting processes like rapid updating of category boundaries as well as the abstraction of category prototypes and inference of new states. Finally, I will consider the relation between representational mechanisms in the hippocampus and general cognitive performance.
